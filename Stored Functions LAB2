1.	Write a stored function named  average_age_per_position, that returns the average age for employees of a given position. The SF takes 1 parameter – the position e.g.
select average_age_per_position (“Lecturer”);
Note: you show round the average age to the nearest year


DELIMITER //
CREATE Function average_age_per_position
(
  pos_param varchar(20)
)
RETURNS int
BEGIN
  DECLARE avg_age int; 
	select avg(age)
    into avg_age
	from lab2.details
	where position = pos_param;
 RETURN avg_age;
END//


OM Database
1.	List all orders that took more than 10 days to ship 

SELECT *, DATEDIFF(shipped_date, order_date) AS 'Diff'
 FROM om.orders where DATEDIFF(shipped_date, order_date) > 10;
 
 2.	What is the full name of the customer  who placed order_id = 70
 
 select concat( customer_first_name, ' ', customer_last_name) AS 'Name' from om.customers where customer_id = 
 (Select customer_id from om.orders where order_id = 70);
 
  select concat( customer_first_name, ' ', customer_last_name) AS 'Name'
  from om.customers
  inner join om.orders
  on customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
  where order_id = 70;
  
  3.	List the title of all the items that were ordered on order id = 264
  
  
   select title from om.items 
 inner join om.order_details
 on items.item_id = order_details.item_id
 where order_id = 264;
 
  
4.	Write a stored function named 	 that returns the number of days it took to ship an order (i.e. difference between shipped_date and order_date)


DELIMITER //
CREATE Function order_days (
ordid int
)
RETURNS int
BEGIN
  DECLARE date_diff int; 
	select DATEDIFF(shipped_date, order_date) 
    into date_diff
    from om.orders
    where order_id = ordid;
	RETURN date_diff;
END//
